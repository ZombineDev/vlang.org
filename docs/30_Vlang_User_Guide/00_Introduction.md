Vlang is an open source Domain Specific Embedded Language (DSEL) built on top of D programming language. At the moment Vlang consists multiple packages. The core part of Vlang is the esdl package. ESDL itself stands for Electronic System Description Language. Additionally Vlang also has a port of the UVM (Universal Verification Methodology). Since the Vlang UVM port is a word-by-word translation of the SystemVerilog UVM library, much of the Vlang User Manual will focus on the core language capabilities provided by the esdl package. For UVM, please refer to the UVM user guide provided by accellera. In this manual, we will only document the UVM extensions exclusive to Vlang.

For details of the underlying D Programming Language, please refer to its homepage at http://dlang.org.
